# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This repository contains my first complete machine learning project based on the iconic Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal of the project is to build a model that predicts whether a given passenger survived or not, based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and more. This project helped me understand the end-to-end data science workflow â€” from data cleaning and exploration to model building and evaluation.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to uncover hidden patterns and better understand the variables affecting survival. For instance, it was observed that women and children had higher survival rates. Passengers from higher classes (especially 1st class) were more likely to survive compared to those in lower classes. Visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps were generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify relationships between features like age, fare, and survival.
# Feature Engineering
Feature engineering played a critical role in this project. Missing values in important columns such as "Age" and "Embarked" were handled using imputation techniques. Categorical variables like "Sex" and "Embarked" were converted into numerical values using label encoding. Additionally, new features were created such as "FamilySize" (SibSp + Parch + 1) and "IsAlone" to better capture family information. Titles (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) were also extracted from the Name column, which improved model performance.
# Conclusion
Various classification algorithms were applied to the preprocessed data, including Logistic Regression,  Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. These models were trained using scikit-learn.  Among the tested models, Random Forest and SVM performed the best in terms of accuracy and generalization.Model evaluation was conducted using accuracy score and classification report, which provided insights into precision, recall, and F1-score. . These metrics helped in understanding not just how many predictions were correct, but how reliable the model was in predicting both classes (survived and not survived). Feature importance analysis showed that "Sex", "Pclass", "Age", and "Fare" were among the most influential features.
